# `05.5` One Last Looping


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Without using the `array.reverse` function, please reverse loop (from the end to the beginning) the whole array and print all the items on the console as you go.

## Expected result:

```js
Annie
Bart
Cesco
Fernando
Lou
Maria
Pedro
Lebron
Ruth
Kiko
Esmeralda
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ Use a `for()` loop like we have been using in previous exercises.

+ Remember that arrays start at position `0`.
