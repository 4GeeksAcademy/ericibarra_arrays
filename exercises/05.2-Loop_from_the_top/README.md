# `05.2` Loop from the top

This loop is looping the array from beginning to end... increasing one by one.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Try looping from the end to the beginning.

## Expected result:

```js
12
25
23
55
56432
48
23
867543
8
654
47889
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The last position of the array will be `mySampleArray.length - 1` because arrays start at 0
