# `06.4` Loop from half to the end

This loop is not looping at all... because the variables `initialValue`, `stopValue` and `increasingValue` are equal to zero `0`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the array.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

## 💻 Expected result:

```js
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```
